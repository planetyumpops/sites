<br>Hello and welcome to my personal resume page. In the past, I have played in a traveling band, served in the Middle East with the USAF, owned a residential painting company, manyfactured my own health food products and a later opened to the public with a restaurant that featured my own products. I enjoyed running my own companies for most of my life, but I have also worked for sereral companies. I have worked in a large-scale food production facility, and even worked in manufacturing assembling commmercial 3D printers most recently.  I have worked in electronics and even avionics in the AF as an F-16 avionics technician. My specialty was communications, navigation and radar <a href="https://www.airforce.com/careers/detail/fighter-aircraft-integrated-avionics">(AFSC 2A3x2).</a> I have a solid background in electroncis and computers. I have always enjoyed working with electronics and programming. I have been attending college for the past year attempting to wrap up my BS in Computer Science. While Georgia State University focuses on the software side of computing, I enjoy working with hardware as well. I hope that <a href="http://www.cs.gsu.edu/">GSU</a> eventually will have a lab necessary for this type of schooling.
